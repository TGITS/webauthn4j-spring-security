=== Web Authentication

Web Authentication is a new, secure web application authentication specification standardizing under W3C.
By combining local authentication, public-key authentication, per-origin key management,
it provides strong authentication to web sites against authentication process attacks like phishing.
Implementation is in progress in major browsers, the specification offers excellent choices for users who place importance on security and convenience.
Initially, the specification was developed as "FIDO 2.0: Web API for accessing FIDO 2.0 credentials" by the FIDO Alliance,
but it has been transferred to W3C.

=== WebAuthn4J Spring Security

WebAuthn4J Spring Security is a Spring Security extension module to provide Web Authentication specification support for your Spring web application.

=== Requirements

==== Language & Framework

* Java8 or later
* Spring Framework 5.0 or later
* Spring Security 5.0 or later

==== Environment

* SecureContext
* Browsers
** Google Chrome 70 or later
** Mozilla Firefox 60 or later
** Microsoft Edge bundled with Windows 10 October 2018 Update or later

===== SecureContext

Web Authentication API is only available in SecureContext, which means only HTTPS connection is permitted while a user
accessing web sites. Browsers rejects Web Authentication API call if the web site is served through HTTP connection
except `localhost`. For more details about SecureContext, please see https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts[MDN].

===== Browsers

As of Jul. 2018, Google Chrome Desktop edition 67 or later and Mozilla Firefox Desktop edition 60 or later supports
Web Authentication. Since these browsers only supports FIDO-U2F tokens, user-verifying authenticators like fingerprint
reader is not supported, they can't be used for password-less authentication.
Meanwhile Microsoft Edge only supports Web Authentication with Insider Preview Build 17682 or later, it supports not only
FIDO-U2F token but also FIDO-CTAP2 roaming authenticators, and Windows Hello as platform authenticators, so Edge supports
password-less authentication.
